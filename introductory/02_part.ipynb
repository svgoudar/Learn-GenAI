    "## What is Generative AI\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generative AI (GenAI)** is a branch of artificial intelligence focused on **creating new content** — text, images, music, code, videos, or even 3D designs — that resembles what humans can produce.\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn’t just analyze data; it **learns patterns** from existing data and then **generates new data** with similar characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Generative AI** is AI that learns from existing data (text, images, etc.) and generates new, original outputs that mimic or extend that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It answers the question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Can a machine **create** instead of only **predict**?”\n",

    "### How It Works (Core Mechanism)\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI models are trained on **large datasets** using deep learning, particularly **neural networks** such as **Transformers** or **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection:** Huge datasets of text, images, audio, etc.\n",
    "2. **Model Training:** The model learns the statistical patterns — relationships, grammar, structure, style, etc.\n",
    "3. **Content Generation:** Given a *prompt* or *input*, the model uses learned probabilities to generate new content.\n",
