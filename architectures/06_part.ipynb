    "## Energy-Based Models (EBMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "An **Energy-Based Model (EBM)** is a **probabilistic deep learning framework** that learns to **assign low energy (high probability)** to desirable or realistic configurations (e.g., real images, valid sentences)\n",
    "and **high energy (low probability)** to undesirable or unlikely configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Intuitive Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of an EBM as a **landscape of hills and valleys**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each point represents a data configuration (an image, sentence, etc.).\n",
    "* The **energy function** assigns a height to each configuration.\n",
    "* **Realistic data → valleys (low energy)**\n",
    "* **Unrealistic data → hills (high energy)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model learns to **shape this energy landscape** so real samples lie in valleys, and fake ones lie on peaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x$ be a data point (e.g., image) and $E_\\theta(x)$ be an **energy function** parameterized by neural network parameters $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model defines a probability distribution as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_\\theta(x) = \\frac{\\exp(-E_\\theta(x))}{Z_\\theta}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Z_\\theta = \\int \\exp(-E_\\theta(x)) dx$ is the **partition function**\n",
    "that normalizes the probabilities (like in physics or Boltzmann statistics).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Low energy ⇒ high probability**\n",
    "* **High energy ⇒ low probability**\n",
    "\n",
    "So, learning an EBM means **minimizing energy for real data** and **increasing energy for fake data**.\n",
