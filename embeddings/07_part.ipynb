    "\n",
    "Nearest Neighbor Search is the process of finding **the vectors most similar** to a query vector inside a large collection of embeddings.\n",

    "\n",
    "* text\n",
    "* sentences\n",
    "* documents\n",
    "* images\n",
    "* audio\n",

    "NNS retrieves the items whose embeddings lie **closest in vector space** to the query.\n",

    "### Why NNS Is Critical in Generative AI\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LLMs cannot “remember” or “search” billions of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we store document embeddings in a **vector database** and use NNS to retrieve the most relevant chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User query → embed → NNS → retrieve relevant docs → feed to LLM\n",

    "* a **query embedding** q\n",
    "* a list of **indexed embeddings** D = {d₁, d₂, … dₙ}\n",
    "\n",
    "NNS finds the top-k closest embeddings based on similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most common metric:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cosine similarity (1 - angular distance)**\n",
    "  Others:\n",
    "* Euclidean distance\n",
    "* Dot-product similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Query: \"What is GDPR?\"\n",
    "Top neighbors:\n",
    "1. Chunk about EU data protection laws\n",
    "2. Chunk about privacy regulations\n",
    "3. Chunk about compliance rules\n",

    "#### **Exact Nearest Neighbor Search (k-NN)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Brute force comparison: compare query with all vectors\n",
    "* O(N × D) time\n",
    "* Too slow for millions of vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Works only for small datasets.\n",

    "#### **Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANN)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Used in all production RAG systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return neighbors that are *almost* the best, but **much faster**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 10× to 1000× faster\n",
    "* Works for millions/billions of embeddings\n",
    "* Small accuracy tradeoff (<1% loss)\n",

    "* **FAISS (Meta)**\n",
    "* **HNSW** (Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds)\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "results = vector_db.search(q, top_k=5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Retrieve best matching chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "Results returned based on **cosine similarity**, not keyword match.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Feed retrieved chunks to the LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "context = concatenate(results)\n",
    "answer = llm(context + user_query)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Without good nearest-neighbor search:\n",
